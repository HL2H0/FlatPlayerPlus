## Controls

> Controllers( DualShock, Xbox, etc.) aren't supported ***yet***

| Key       | Action                     | Note                                                                                               |  
|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| R         | Reload                     | To reload, first eject the magazine, then grab a magazine from the belt, and click `R`             |  
| W         | Drive Forward              | While holding `W` the character leans forward, to avoid that, hold `S`                             |  
| LeftShift | Drive Backwards            | Why LeftShift? Because `S` is used to avoid the lean that happens when holding `W`                 |  
| LeftCtrl  | Ragdoll (CodeMod Required) | Open RagdollPlayer's menu and change Binding to `THUMBSTICK_PRESS`, and change Hand To `LEFT_HAND` |
