 ## Controls
 The Bindings are hardcoded so you can't customize it ***yet***
 also controllers(DualShock, Xbox, etc) aren't supported ***yet***


| Key      | Action | Note|
| ----| ---- |----|
| R| Reload| To reload, first eject the magazine, then grab a magazine from the belt, and click `R` |
| W| Drive Forward | While holding `W` the character leans forward, to avoid that, hold `S` |
| LeftShift| Drive Backwards| Why LeftShift? Because `S` is used to avoid the lean that happens when holding `W` 
|LeftCtrl|Ragdoll (CodeMod Required)| Open RagdollPlayer's menu and change Binding to `THUMBSTICK_PRESS`, and change Hand To `LEFT_HAND`
